# Blog Application Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation of a blog application built using **Java and Spring Boot**.

The project focuses on designing clean, scalable RESTful APIs with secure authentication and proper database modeling. It uses **JWT-based authentication** and **PostgreSQL** for data persistence through **Spring Data JPA and Hibernate**.

The codebase follows a layered architecture to ensure maintainability and ease of future extension.

🚧 The project is currently under active development.
